## FAQs

1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?
- Many of the documents that we create in computer sicence is formatted as plain text such as source code (Java, 
  Python, C, etc.) are written in plain text. Furthermore, Writing Markdown formatted plain text files alows them to be opened 
  and read in almost all environments. Lastly, Markdown is a format that is long-lived; you can still open 
  and read files written in the 90s however, you can't open many word processor formats today.
